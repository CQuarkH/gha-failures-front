    "message": "[Segment Cache] Implement prefetch inlining\n\nIn the Segment Cache implementation, we split page prefetches into\nmultiple requests so that each one can be cached and deduped\nindependently. For example, if multiple pages share the same layout, the\ndata for that layout only needs to be fetched once. This approach can\ngreatly reduce the overall transfer size at the cost of additional\nrequests, which is typically minimal, especially since it happens during\nthe prefetch phase.\n\nHowever, some segments are small enough that the potential caching\nbenefits are not worth additional network overhead. So we can inline\nthem directly into the initial route tree prefetch response, potentially\navoiding a separate request. Again, it's not a perfect trade-off, since\nthat separate request may have been skipped anyway if the segment was\nalready cached. It's just a heuristic. But below some size, inlining\nis worth it.\n\n(Publicly, we may end up referring to this strategy as prefetch\n_outlining_ rather than _inlining_, since compared to the current\nNext.js behavior, that's the part that's actually new in the\nSegment Cache.)\n\nI've chosen 2KB (gzipped) as the default threshold. We can do some more\nresearch and tweak this later.\n\nIn addition to using the size of the segment prefetch, we also take into\nconsideration the total inlined size of the tree prefetch. The idea is\nthat even if each individual segment is below the inlining threshold,\nat some point it no longer makes sense to add more bytes to the tree\nprefetch, because the tree prefetch requests are unique per URL and\ncannot be deduped the way segments can. I've chosen 10KB as the default\nfor this limit.\n\nDeeper segments are more likely to be unique to a page, so they are\nmore likely to benefit from inlining. We prioritize the deepest segments\nwhen inlining.\n\nFor now, the prefetch thresholds are hardcoded. We may make them\nconfigurable, by ideally the defaults are good enough that it isn't\nnecessary. One reason to expose the configuration, though, is that some\napps may be more sensitive to the number of requests than others. By\nsetting a very large inlining threshold, you can effectively disable\nthe layout deduping feature and \"revert\" back to something closer to\nthe existing Next.js behavior. We'll think about this more\nbefore release.\n\nAnother thing worth considering is whether to use different inlining\nthresholds for different network conditions. For example, mobile devices\non slow networks may benefit from more aggressive inlining, whereas\ndevices on WiFi benefit more from deduping. To do this, we would\ngenerate multiple prefetch responses per page and the client would\nrequest the appropriate one based on the\n[Network Information API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Network_Information_API).",
